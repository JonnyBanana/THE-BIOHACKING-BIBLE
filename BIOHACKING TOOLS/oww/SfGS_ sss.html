Every year, SfGS participates in an annual meeting with the other student communities in the WSC-SD.

This year's meeting will focus on "Taking Action for Global Sustainability," and will be held in Tokyo March 5-9, 2007.  The call for participants is out!  If you're interested, please take a minute to fill out the registration form by November 14.  Abstracts of your previous work or ideas, which form the basis of social capital for "Seeds of Sustainability," will be submitted later this month.  Read on for more:
