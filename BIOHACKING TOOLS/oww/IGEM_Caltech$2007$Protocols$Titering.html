==Titering==

#Grow fresh overnight cultures of the bacteria of interest (i.e. LE392, D1210, etc.) [[Image:Phage_titer.jpg|right|frame|An example plate. Dark spots are cleared zones in a lawn of bacteria.]]
#Incubate the cultures until they reach an OD600 of roughly 0.1 
#* More specifically, when the culture is swirled, cloudiness is observed
#Do NOT titer with bacterial cultures that have just been diluted from a culture past OD600 of 0.8 (complications will occur)
#Place agar/agarose plates in the 42 C oven and ready the 48 C water bath
#Prepare fresh 10 mM MgSO4 solution from the 1 M MgSO4 stock solution (100 ul MgSO4 in 10 mL sterile water works conveniently)
#In 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes, add 1 mL of the 10 mM MgSO4 solution.
#Prepare phage dilutions by adding appropriate amount of phage into MgSO4 solution (i.e. 1000-fold dilution is 1 ul phage in 1 ml MgSO4)
#After addition of phage to solution, invert tube at least 12 times for sufficient mixing
#For further dilutions, can simply dilute made phage dilutions (i.e. 1,000,000-fold can be obtained from taking 1 ul 1000-fold diluted phage and adding to another 1 mL of 10 mM MgSO4
#Aliquot 0.1 mL cell solution (i.e. LE392, D1210, etc.) into new 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes
#To begin infection, add appropriate amount of diluted phage to cell solution (10 ul usually works well for starters) and start the timer
#During this 30 minute infection period, label the plates and place back in the 42 C oven
#~3 minutes before the end of infection, can take 3 mL aliquots of the top medium in 13 mL falcon tubes or 5 mL round-bottom tubes and microwave till complete liquification has occurred. 
#Right before the end of infection, take out the plates and place on the bench with the cover on top.  Have a flame close-by to prevent contamination.  Also, set the pippette to the right volume of infected cell solution and have sterile pipette non-filter tips ready   
#Very quickly with pipette in hand, pippette out infected cell solution, add to top medium, invert the tube at least 2 times, and pour the mixed contents onto the corresponding plate.  
#Rock the plate gently to allow the top medium to uniformly cover the plate and use the sterile tips to poke any bubbles.
#Let the plate cool on the bench for at least 5 minutes (10 minutes is usually enough) with the cover completely on the plate.
#Place the plate in the 37 C incubator.
