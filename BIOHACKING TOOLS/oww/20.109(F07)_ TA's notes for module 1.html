==General notes==
Notes: 
NB271 is a strain that can be selected for on LB-Kan media. It does not contain the M13K07 plasmid, but it has the F pilus that is necessary for M13K07 to infect it. 
NB251 is also a strain that can be selected for on LB-Kan- it contains the M13K07 plasmid. 

Before term begins:
# Check that all links on all wiki pages for M13 redesign module are properly direct to current version of class and to working webpages. Fix broken ones. 
# Pour several liters of LB+Kan (~2L) and LB (~4L) plates. 
# Streak out NB251 (M13K07) on LB+Kan. Make 16 overnight cultures (each 2.5 ml LB+Kan). Miniprep these for the vector DNA the next day. Resuspend each pellet in 50 ul H20. You do not have to pool since each group in the class will be given one tube for their cloning experiment that starts on Day1 of the module. Store at -20°. 
# Double-check volume of needed oligos: for cloning control, for sequencing. 
# NEB titers M13K07 on their strain [http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/productE4103.asp ER2267] cat#E4103S. This strain is in the lab collection as NB271. Streak out a plate on LB+Kan so you will have colonies to pick for liquid cultures before phage titration. The Kan is important to select for the F'. This is just to check that the phage stock is still active.
# Autoclave several racks of small and large test tubes. 
# Make 1L top agar, divide between autoclaved 250 ml bottles, 100 ml per bottle for reheating
# Check volume/availability of needed kits, reagents: 
#* [http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/productN0315.asp M13K07 from NEB]
#* restriction enzymes (BamHI,others on list of no cutters [[Media:Macintosh HD-Users-nkuldell-Desktop-M13K07 zerocutters 109lab.txt| here]] )
#* Qiagen kit for agarose clean-up (need 1/pair of students)
#* T4 DNA ligase and buffer for ligation mix
#* super competent XL1-blue cells (need one tube of 200 ul/pair of students)
#* miniprep solutions
#* protein gels (need 3/ lab section)
#* Anti-p3 antibody

==Daily Notes==
===[[20.109(F07):Start-up_genome_engineering | Notes:Day 1]]===
