==Materials==
* Plate of cells streaked for single colonies
* [[SOB]]
* Ice
* [[TB buffer]]
* DMSO
* Dry Ice (or liquid nitrogen)

==Glassware & equipment==
* 2 liter erlenmeyer flask (no detergent residue, rinse with 70% ethanol and DI water)
* 220 ml conical centrifuge tubes BD 35 2075
* Eppendorf 5410R refrigerated centrifuge with conical adapters

==Preparation==
# Pick a 10 - 12 large single colonies (2-3 mm dia) from your source plate and inoculate 500 ml of sterile SOB medium (do not use LB) in a 2 liter flask.  Save some medium as an OD blank.
# Grow to  an OD of 0.6 with vigorous shaking (200-250 rpm) at 18 degrees (important).  This is slow -- approximately 35-40 hours.
# Prechill the centrifuge to 4 degrees
# Remove from the incubator and place on ice for 10 minutes
# Transfer to two 220 ml centrifuge tubes and spin at 3220 x g for 10 minutes at 4 degrees
# Drain the medium and resuspend each pellet first in 5 ml of ice cold TB.  Add  an additional 75 ml of cold TB buffer and resuspend.
# Place on ice for 10 minutes
# Spin down as above.
# While spinning, add 1.4 ml of DMSO to 18.6 ml of TB  (7% DMSO mixture)
# Resuspend each pellet in 20 ml of cold TB-DMSO mixture
# Incubate on ice for 10 minutes
# Dispense cells into pre-chilled tubes
# Freeze cells in a dry ice / ethanol bath and store at -80 degrees indefinitely

==Thoughts on improvements==
* "Methods in Yeast Genetics" book (Amberg05) suggests growth the SOB + 300 mM NaCl
* They also control pH at 7.5, which may be a major issue
* Centrifuging in flat bottom centrifuge tubes may make pellet resuspension easier and less damaging
* Length of time on ice prior to transformation may make a big difference
* The Hanahan protocol specifies dry pure DMSO, while Inoue says it doesn't make a difference.  Let's see.
* Warm plates for growing cells after transformation are claimed to be 2x to 4x more efficient.
* My lab uses LB for instead of SOB media...it seems to work fine for them--[[User:Melissali|mel]] 18:10, 14 June 2007 (EDT)
