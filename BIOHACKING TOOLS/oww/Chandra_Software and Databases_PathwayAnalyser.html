[http://sourceforge.net/projects/pathwayanalyser PathwayAnalyser] (PA) is a tool for systems biologists for analysis of metabolic pathways, particularly by Flux Balance Analysis and ODE simulation. PA interfaces with the [http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/glpk.html  GNU Linear Programming Toolkit (GLPK)] for linear programming, as well as with [http://www.maia.ub.es/~angel/taylor/ Taylor] for performing high precision simulations (e.g. using [http://www.swox.com/gmp/ GMP]). [http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~swright/ooqp/ OOQP] is used for quadratic programming/MoMA. It can give a comprehensive report on gene deletions from the [http://sbml.org/ Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)] Model input. It is currently a command-line tool but a GUI may be added soon.

It is written in C++ and uses [http://www.sbml.org/software/libsbml/ libSBML] and GLPK. PA is meant for linux (excl. [http://www.cygwin.com/ cygwin] at the moment) but it is planned that it will be usable in all platforms in the future.
