Hi, please feel free to list possible speakers for the large lecture event this Fall.

Three Big Questions to be answered:

#What types of seminar should we do?
 *One day or large seminar series (like we did in the past)?
 *How many speakers? / Any discussions or panel among them?
 *Mixer afterwards? What type?
#What should be the theme of the seminar?
 *Sustainable development? (what specifically?)
 *Environment-focused? (this is still huge)
 *What kind of theme can attract general MIT student body? - tech oriented? business oriented?
#So, who should we invite?
 *Name it, please:-)
Maybe, someone from UN Millennium project[http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/index.htm Millennium Project]






* Oh, I found the following page:

Maybe, we could write on our proposal saying, we are going to invite one or several speakers from here or something like that...  (Shan)

Masa's ideas:

* [http://www.giss.nasa.gov/staff/jhansen.html Dr. James Hansen from NASA]
** Masa has some connection.

*[http://www.earth-policy.org/About/index.htm#bios Lester Brown (founder of Earth Policy Institute)]
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gro_Harlem_Brundtland Gro Harlem Brundtland (former WHO director)]
**may be too expensive to invite.
