      <h1>Open source biotechnology?</h1>
      <p>Ultimately, the view I am taking for the purposes of this
project is that the business case for open source software is not in
question - it has already proved itself. The crucial question is whether
the differences between software development and biotechnology R&amp;D
doom the open source biotechnology approach to failure. The following
sections offer some preliminary thoughts on this question.</p>

      <br>
      <h2>A plausible scenario?</h2>
Imagine a small biotechnology company that generates revenue by
exploiting an in-house proprietary technology platform centred around a
patented technique widely used in both animal and plant research. Some
of the company's income comes from licensing fees derived from granting
an exclusive licence to another company to produce a range of laboratory
kits incorporating the technique; the licensee chooses to produce kits
only for animal research. The bulk of the company's revenue comes not
from licence fees, however, but from performing contract research and
data analysis services, mainly for the meat industry, and by selling
software for analysing data generated by means of the technique.<br>
      <br>
      <p>As well as direct revenue generating activities, this
imaginary company engages in research and development activities. The
company devotes a substantial proportion of its resources each year to
research, which is of economic importance to the company in two ways:
first, it maintains and improves the technology platform on which the
company's revenue-generating activities are based, and second, it
attracts customers for services and software by enhancing a reputation
for high-quality work and expertise in the field. Because our imaginary
company is small, its stand-alone research capacity is limited. In
response, the company makes a point of pooling research resources in
corporate partnerships with other research organisations. The results of
these collaborations are then privately owned.</p>
      <p>Is this company's patented technique a good candidate for open
source licensing? It could be, for the following reasons. First, the
company obtains only a fraction of its total revenue from licensing
fees; it already operates largely in the secondary markets of research
and software sales. If the number of users of the patented technique
were to increase, even if those users did not pay licence fees, the
market for the company's research and software offerings would expand.
Second, according to our imagined scenario, the company devotes
significant resources to R&amp;D and would therefore probably benefit
from sharing those costs with a group of external user-developers. Any
improvements in the use value of the patented technique would directly
benefit the company because it doesn't just sell the technology, it is
also a major user in its contract research and data analysis activities.
Building a user community would also help build the company's valuable
reputation for high-quality research. Third, suppose that the patented
technique is no longer at the very cutting edge of research tools in its
area. This would mean that the competitive edge in research services
that the company gains by exclusive possession of the technique is
starting to trail off, and user loyalty and overall satisfaction are
becoming more important.</p>
      <p>Finally, there is a whole set of potential users - and
therefore potential customers for closed source technologies built on
the platform of the patented technique - who are being prevented by the
company's existing licensing arrangements from gaining access to
modified versions of the technology that would be useful in their
research (i.e., plant researchers). This is a lost opportunity that
opening up the exclusive licence could help recover.</p>
      <p>This hypothetical example demonstrates that there may well be
biotechnology companies for whom a proprietary technology currently
represents "the crown jewels" that could benefit economically from
converting to an open source approach to intellectual property
management. It also provides a concrete setting for a discussion (in the
next section) of the ways in which the open source/closed source
trade-off might differ between the software and biotechnology contexts.</p>

      <h2>Lessons from open hardware</h2>
      <p>Benkler (Benkler. 2002. <em>Coase's Penguin, or, Linux and
The Nature of the Firm</em>. 112 Yale L.J. (Winter 2002-03). Available
at http://www.law.nyu.edu/benklery/.) has suggested that the success of
commons-based peer production depends on relativly low physical capital
costs and information transaction costs. One obvious difference between
computer software and biotechnology research tools is that computer
software is digital information, while many biotechnology tools are
physical objects. The open hardware movement is of interest because,
like the concept of open source biotechnology, it extends open source
principles into a context where physical capital costs are
non-negligible.</p>
      <p><a id="90" name="90"></a></p>
      <h3>What is open hardware?</h3>
      <p>The open hardware movement has its roots in the radical
technology movement of the 1960s, inspired by Ivan Illich's "Tools for a
Convivial Society", and the subsequent development of bazaar-style chip
manufacture. It is currently enjoying a renaissance for a number of
reasons, including the success of the free software movement and the
advent of the Internet.</p>
      <p>"Open source hardware" refers to computer hardware for which
all the design information is made available to the general public. A
"free" or "libre" hardware design is a design which can be freely
copied, distributed, modified and manufactured; the fact are design is
free does not imply that it cannot be sold or that any hardware
implementation of the design will be free of cost. Open source hardware
may or may not be based on a free hardware design.</p>
      <p>The term "open hardware" has a more precise meaning than
either of these terms. For hardware to be open hardware:</p>
      <p>1. Its design must be publicly accessible in a form that
enables implementation and full understanding.</p>
      <p>2. The software tools used to create the design should be free
so that others can develop and improve the design.</p>
      <p>3. The software interface to the hardware must be publicly
accessible and free to use.</p>
      <p><a id="91" name="91"></a></p>
      <h3>A sceptical viewpoint</h3>
      <p>Open hardware, like open source, has its share of ideologues
and sceptics; here we are interested in the sceptics' view. Sceptics of
open hardware have made a number of points that could also potentially
be applied to open source biotechnology. These are listed here in order
to highlight some of the differences between software and biotechnology
research tools with respect to the feasibility of open source
development that may be associated with the non-digital nature of many
biotechnology research tools.</p>
      <p>The first point is that no generally accepted open hardware
licences yet exist. As noted in an earlier section, copyleft licences
(and other forms of open source software licence) rely on copyright: the
copyright owner uses his or her exclusive rights to guarantee certain
freedoms for users of the software program covered by the licence.
However, as with biotechnology research tools, computer hardware is
mostly protected by patent. In contrast to copyright protection, which
is quick, cheap and simple, obtaining a patent is a costly,
time-consuming process; moreover, maintaining a patent requires the
payment of substantial renewal fees. (There may be other relevant
differences between patent protection and copyright protection besides
cost -- if so, they will be explored as part of this project.) The costs
of obtaining patent protection may make patent owners less willing than
copyright owners to give up the income stream associated with standard
proprietary licensing, and/or it may discourage otherwise willing
contributors to an open source biotechnology project who are not in a
position to obtain patent protection for their contributions. The
question of how to translate open source licences into the context of
patent protection (and other types of protection that may apply to
biotechnology research tools) is an important one for open hardware, and
also for open source biotechnology. Licensing experiments in the open
hardware context continue: for example, the Indian Simputer is subject
to a lawyer-drafted GPL-like licence.</p>
      <p>The second point made by open hardware sceptics that may also
apply to open source biotechnology is that hardware is not as modular
and compartmentalised as software. Benkler has emphasised modularity as
an important feature of successful open source projects, in particular
in connection with contributors' motivation. However, open hardware
sceptics have raised a different point, which is that unless the
technology itself is highly modular and compartmentalised, small changes
to one part are likely to interact in unforeseen ways with the rest.
Whether this is in fact a difference between software and hardware is
not clear. However, the general point may be particularly relevant to
biotechnology research tools, as many are living organisms or components
of living organisms: unpredictable, delayed side-effects in response to
apparently small changes are established characteristics of living
organisms as a class of complex systems.</p>
      <p>The third point is that capital costs associated with hardware
manufacture are higher than for software, so that human creativity costs
are a smaller proportion of the total costs in the hardware context. (As
we saw earlier, Benkler suggests that the advantages of the peer
production mode relative to other modes relate to information about and
allocation of human creativity, and become salient when human creativity
is a salient component of production.) Capital costs for hardware
manufacture are higher than for software manufacture in relation to both
development (for example, tools for developing, testing and debugging
software are much cheaper and more easily made accessible -- e.g. by
Internet and open source software licensing, as many such tools are
themselves software -- than tools for developing hardware) and
production (for example, silicon for making chips costs money). Open
hardware sceptics have suggested that there are therefore minimal
start-up costs for software programmers but not for hardware developers,
and further, that resulting reliance on institutional funding for
hardware manufacture makes the process more vulnerable to conservative
institutional attitudes and employment-related legal constraints. (As
noted in an earlier section, the latter problems may be partially solved
by top-down influence on institutional thinking by, for example,
funding agencies such as the NIH, and by direct participation in open
source biotechnology projects by institutions or companies, as distinct
from individual employees.)</p>
      <p>As we have seen in earlier sections, these issues also arise
in relation to many biotechnology research tools (although the ability
of living organisms to self-replicate means that for some, production
costs at least may be negligible). It is important to realise that there
are likely to be exceptions to every generalisation about biotechnology
research tools, as the term is being used here in its broadest possible
sense; part of the aim of this study is to identify particular research
tools, or classes of research tools, that may be more amenable to open
source licensing than others. As noted earlier, discussions of open
source software often invoke the stereotype of the hobbyist hacker alone
at a home computer needing nothing but an Internet connection and packet
of Doritos, whereas in fact a lot of open source software development
and production is carried out by professional programmers employed in
various public and private sector institutions and may involve
non-negligible costs: in other words, the differences between costs of
software development and biotechnology research and development may
often be exaggerated. In addition, although biotech research probably
will remain more expensive on average than software development, some
biotechnology research and development projects may be less capital
intensive than others. The bioinformatics revolution in biology is
already making it possible for some researchers to work from secondary
data instead of doing everything in the lab. Even for wet lab
inventory, some costs are going down rapidly; for example, is now
possible to get the parts for a DNA sequence synthesiser that would have
cost US $100,000 several years ago for about US $10,000. The point is
that the question whether differences in capital costs are likely to
determine the success or failure of open source biotechnology is a
matter for empirical study and will depend on the circumstances of each
case -- there can be no foregone conclusion.</p>
      <p>A final point arising from skeptical writings on open hardware
relates to motivation -- not to contribute to a project, but to explore
the concept itself and find ways to overcome obstacles. Richard Stallman
has asserted that freedom to copy hardware is not as important as
freedom to copy software because copying software is easy to do, whereas
copying hardware is difficult. Whether or not this argument has any
merit in its original context, the factual premise -- that copying is
difficult -- is not true of many biotechnology research tools,
especially those that are able to self-replicate. In fact, this ability
raises a different kind of potential obstacle to open source development
in the biotechnology context: because modifications to living organisms
can spread without human intervention, the origin of modifications to a
living research tool such as a cell line are very difficult to trace,
and it is also very difficult to define such modifications in the
definition section of a license (the NIH uniform biological material
transfer agreement has provisions that attempt to deal with this
problem). This difficulty, of course, applies generally to licensing of
biotechnology research tools, not just to open source licensing, and in
fact may create more of a problem in the drafting of standard
proprietary licences (this is a matter for further consideration).
Indeed, critics of genetic engineering might see this problem of
definitions as a symptom of a larger problem that is pervasive in
biotechnology research and development, that of philosophical
reductionism. [Not clear how to integrate writings on this topic --
leave for a later revision.]</p>
      <p>A similar point to Stallman's, made in response to Dan Burk's
paper on open source genomics, is that in the biotechnology community
the history of commercialisation may have generated a greater commitment
to the standard proprietary business and licensing model than in the
software community, resulting in more cultural resistance to the concept
of open source. This appears to be a fairly drastic generalisation;
presumably it matters which sector of the "community" one is thinking
of. Some parts of the software development community are notoriously
committed to the standard proprietary model and resistant to the concept
of open source, but this has not prevented open source from gaining a
foothold elsewhere. Some players in the pharmaceutical and agricultural
biotechnology industries have a long tradition of commitment to
aggressively closed intellectual property management practices, but
others have an equally long tradition of commitment to open scientific
communication and the public interest, while still others are simply
trying to make a living and may well be willing to consider even a
radical departure from the standard business model if an alternative
model promises lower costs or increased profits. It may be that the
most sympathetic audience for ideas about open source biotechnology
will be researchers and institutions in developing countries and
institutions that have their interests at heart. Interestingly, the
renaissance of the open hardware movement has been partly attributed to
the efforts of developing countries to develop "convivial tools" as an
alternative technology strategy in response to global expansion of
intellectual property protection; one of the most successful open
hardware projects to date is the <a
 href="http://opencollector.org/Whyfree/freedesign.html" target="_blank">Simputer</a>.
("The Simputer is not a Personal Computer in the conventional `PC'
sense. The `Win-tel' architecture of the de facto standard PC is quite
unsuitable for deployment in the low-cost mass-market of any developing
country... [the Simputer] is targeted as a shared computing device for a
local community of users. A local community such as the village
panchayat or the village school, or a kiosk, should be able to give this
device out to individuals for a specific period of time and then pass it
on to others in the community. Designed with this application in mind,
the Simputer is heavily based on personalization through the use of
smart cards. Other related designs are the MIT Pengachu (designed for
minimal power consumption, perhaps even wind-up)." -

Declaration on Information Technology for Developing Countries.]</p>
      <p>The next section of the website discusses other issues and
potential obstacles that have been raised in connection with the concept
of open source biotechnology that do not have any strong parallel with
respect to open hardware.</p>
      <p><a id="92" name="92"></a></p>
      <h2>Other issues</h2>
      <p>A number of other differences between software and
biotechnology research tools may affect the likely outcome of the
trade-off between open source and closed source business strategies in
the biotechnology context compared with the software context.</p>
      <p>First, the costs of effective communication and coordination
among contributors to a distributed development effort may be much
higher in the biotechnology context, due to the less codified nature of
much of the relevant information (for example experimental protocols
that may be difficult to reproduce reliably outside the laboratory where
they originated) and the need to exchange biological materials such as
vectors, cell lines, knockout mice etc. Recall that for Mandeville,
codification represents formalised learning -- that is, learning
arranged and organised into a pattern -- and the costs of exchanging
highly codified information, of which software code is an excellent
example, are lower than for uncodified information. (With regard to
biological materials, although the information contained in such
materials is "embodied in a tangible object", the complexity of the
object and its overall information content -- e.g. a living organism --
means that this type of information belongs at the "uncodified" end of
Mandeville's information spectrum.) This is true not just for the giver
of information but also for the receiver. While the Internet can
certainly lower costs of some types of communication that would be
necessary among contributors to an open source biotechnology project, it
is unlikely that such a project would be able to dispense entirely with
face-to-face meetings (e.g. to transfer technical skills) and physical
networks (i.e. postal and courier services).</p>
      <p>There are two possible replies to this point. First, some
proponents of the application of open source principles to biology have
predicted that new technologies such as rapid DNA synthesis machines may
eliminate the need for physical networks in some cases: they suggest
that instead of genetic samples being sent in the mail, it might become
possible to send sequence information via telephone lines in electronic
form to be received by DNA synthesis machines that would replicate the
physical sample. The obvious concern with this kind of solution to the
costs of exchanging biological information is that it may exacerbate
distortions associated with the already highly reductionist character of
biotechnology research. Second, there already exist distributed
development projects in the biotechnology field that, one way and
another, have succeeded in overcoming the difficulties of establishing
communication and structuring and effective community. The existence of
such initiatives indicates that the real question for the purposes of
this project is not so much whether biotechnology research and
development can be successfully conducted in a distributed fashion --
after all, this is the traditional academic mode of production -- but
whether it can sustain itself without enormous injections of external
funding (bearing in mind, of course, that there is no reason to impose
more stringent self-sufficiency requirements on open source
biotechnology than on "closed" biotechnology, which does rely to some
degree on public funding [see pie chart p7 BIO Report 2003]). This
question is discussed in more detail below, but finding even a tentative
answer will not be easy -- it is a major objective of this project.</p>
      <p>A second issue that has been raised as a possible obstacle to
establishing a successful open source biotechnology project is the need
to comply with biosafety and biosecurity regulations. This is also a
requirement for non-open source biotechnology research and development,
and it is not clear that the costs of compliance would necessarily be
higher for an open source project than for other projects. The existence
of regulations also does not of itself constitute a difference between
biotechnology and software: for example, in the US software is subject
to export controls for national security reasons, and this has not
prevented open source development (although it is an issue that has had
to be dealt with: open source licences are not allowed to discriminate
among users on the ground of nationality or any other ground). However,
this does not mean there are no differences in the costs of compliance
between the software and biotechnology contexts; one obvious point is
that food and especially medicine are two key areas of application for
biotechnology research tools, and these areas are both subject to
regulatory processes that are both expensive and time-consuming. It has
been suggested that these costs may "raise the bar" in terms of
motivation to contribute to an open source project so high that open
source development is simply not feasible. For example, we saw earlier
that experience in the software context suggests contributors should be
able to see their contributions incorporated into the technology as
quickly as possible. One preliminary response to this concern is that
the costs of obtaining approval for a new food or medicine will
generally be incurred after the process of development has been
completed, so that they need not necessarily affect that process. (This
answer may seem surprising given that strong intellectual property
protection for pharmaceutical products has long been justified by
reference to a supposed lack of incentives to invest in research and
development in the face of high regulatory costs, but it is important to
realise that this justification presupposes that the dominant incentive
to invest in research and development is economic, whereas an open
source development project, even if it is initiated by a business for
economic gain, relies on contributors being motivated by incentives
other than economic incentives.) If this is true then in Benkler's terms
the problem of compliance costs is an integration problem that might be
solved by the intervention of a firm in the closing stages of the
project.</p>
      <p>Of course, the costs of complying with regulations are not the
only issue being raised here. The real concern may be that if open
source biotechnology eventually allows people to hack new viruses in
their garage, it could create a serious public health and/or security
risk. In response, some would argue that the widespread release of GM
crops into the environment without long-range environmental impact
studies over the last few years shows that industry and governments
cannot be trusted with biosafety issues either. In fact, the fact that
an open source approach to biotechnology research and development may
have the capacity to weaken government (in particular, US government)
and industry control over the rate and especially the direction of
scientific progress in this field is part of its appeal. Acknowledging,
however, that this argument does not resolve the issue completely, it is
worth noting that when similar concerns have arisen in the software
context, one counterargument has been that no matter how tightly
controlled the technology may be, people who wish to use it for (e.g.)
terrorist purposes will always be able to obtain access somehow through
sheer commitment to the goal, and when that happens, the safety of the
majority lies in open access to the technology so that there may be as
many technically competent defenders as possible: in biotechnology
terms, the more people who are equipped to look for a vaccine to a newly
created virus, the more quickly a vaccine will be found. The "safety in
numbers" argument also applies to unintentionally created threats.
Ultimately, however, these are broad public policy issues that cannot
and perhaps need not be resolved in the context of this project.</p>
      <p>A third issue relating to the difference in subject matter
between the software and biotechnology contexts that may affect the
overall trade-off between open source and more traditional business
approaches is that biological functions are highly conserved at the
molecular level, so that in relation to many biotechnology research
tools there will be very limited scope for substitution or imitation or
even further innovation. [Charles Lawson has made this point in relation
to Taq polymerase and erythropoetin.] Exactly how the difficulty (or
even impossibility) of "inventing around" some biotechnology research
tools will affect the open source-closed source trade-off is a matter
for further consideration. Clearly, this characteristic of biotechnology
research tools is relevant to the question whether they should be
protected by patent at all, but this is not a concern of the present
study.</p>
      <p>Another potential obstacle to open source biotechnology
alleged in response to Dan Burk's paper titled "Open Source Genomics" is
that the research and development process in biotechnology is
characterised by more obvious endpoints than is the process of software
development. It is not clear whether this is true either in general or
for any given project, but in any case, it has been argued that these
obvious endpoints would lead to a collective action problem for
cooperative projects because as the project nears its endpoint, the
incentive for each participant to defect from cooperation and reap the
benefits on its own increases; if the endpoint can be seen from the
start, cooperation tends to unravel by a process of induction backwards
from the endpoint. This argument is based on the experience among cartel
members of difficulties in enforcing member loyalty to the scheme (Peter
Drahos has argued that increasing reliance on intellectual property by
multinational firms is in fact a response to this problem). The major
flaw in this argument is that the very ability to "defect" from an open
source project would require the legal failure of the licence scheme.
Assuming it is possible to come up with a legally enforcable open
source biotechnology licence, such a licence would provide security
against defection: that would be its purpose.</p>
      <p>A further perceived difference between software development
and biotechnology R&amp;D is cultural. It is argued that the history of
commercialisation in biotechnology is such that members of the
biotechnology community are more committed to making large profits from
research and development than are members of the software community.
This seems a rather drastic generalisation, that has not (as far as I
know) been backed by empirical evidence. It may be true that investor
expectations are higher in the biotechnology context (see next
paragraph). However, in relation to the general point about culture, it
can equally be argued that there are significant cultural similarities
between the biotech and software development communities. Some of these
are a matter of divergent evolution -- both communities originally came
from, and remain substantially rooted in, an academic environment. Other
similarities may be a result of the bioinformatics revolution, which is
closing the disciplinary gap between molecular biology and computer
science; as genomic sequence information becomes available for more and
more organisms, the cultural impact of this disciplinary overlap is
likely to spread. (In fact, bioinformatics is one field in which nearly
all the relevant software is open source). As in the software context,
where programmers are often said to be motivated to participate in open
source projects by a desire to enhance their reputations, reputation is
a strong motivator in the biotechnology research community.</p>
      <p>Another issue to be considered when comparing the likely
outcome of the open source/closed source trade-off in the software and
biotechnology context is whether in the biotechnology context there
exist viable equivalents to the secondary markets companies are starting
to exploit in the software context (discussed above in the section on
open source business models). As noted earlier, from a commercial
perspective this consideration boils down to what specific value the
company would be adding, what it would be worth from other customers'
point of view, and whether that would be enough to support a business
(or in the case of non-profit institutions, to make up for a funding
shortfall). The question then becomes what is "enough"? The answer
depends, among other things, on investors expectations, i.e. what return
is regarded as sufficient over what timeframe. In the pharmaceutical
industry, some investors may be used to demanding 25% profit per annum,
which is quite an ask for any business, open source or not, but whether
this expectation is usual I do not know, and whether it is much higher
than in analogous circumstances in the software industry is not clear.
Certainly, no business model is bombproof, and recently there has been
some commercial fallout in the open source software context. The point
is that, as the first section under this heading shows, it is possible
to construct a plausible hypothetical scenario in which it may be
possible for a biotechnology company to improve its overall
profitability by adopting an open source strategy. Whether there is any
real company for which this is true comes down to specifics and is the
question this project will attempt to answer.</p>
      <p>Finally, there is the question of demand for open source
products in biotechnology. This is related to the subject matter of the
previous paragraph, in that it essentially deals with the question
whether there is sufficient demand for such products to sustain
secondary markets that can support commercial enterprise. Some users of
biotechnology research tools may value open source products because of
their mode of production, just as many consumerse prefer to buy from
companies that respect the rights of their employees. However, it has
been pointed out in the software context that ultimately, open source
itself is merely a feature of production; the benefit for users from
using open source tools is control. Thus, we must ask whether choice and
control are qualities that are valued by users/consumers of
biotechnology research tools. I would argue the answer is yes. For
example, although the consumer backlash against genetically modified
foods has been complex, one of its most striking themes has been
resentment at having the decision whether to eat or grow genetically
engineered products.</p>

      <h2>Comments on open source and drug development</h2>
In this section, "Maurer's proposal" refers to S. Maurer, New
Institutions for Doing Science: From Databases to Open Source Biology,
conference paper, European Policy for Intellectual Property, University
of Maastricht, November 2003, available at
http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~scotch/maurer.htm.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>Maurer's proposal</h3>
As I understand it, Maurer's proposal emphasises the idea of harnessing
the input of a large number of unpaid volunteers to scan biological
information (eg genomic sequence information) in order to identify
potential drug targets. The motivation is that this will be cheaper than
paying full-time researchers and also more effective because, as the
software people say, "given enough eyes, all bugs are shallow".  It
seems like a good idea, assuming it solves a relevant technical problem
in identifying drug targets (ie lack of computational and human
"scanning" resources).  How much difference it will make to drug
development costs overall depends on whether that phase is really the
bottleneck in terms of expense.  <br>
      <br>
Obviously, the proposal is "open source" in the sense of adopting a
relatively non-hierachical contribution and management structure.  It's
not entirely clear whether it is also intended to be "open source" with
regard to IP.  The connection between the development methodology and IP
aspects of open source is essentially that an open source approach to IP
helps to motivate volunteer contributors by assuring them that they will
have continuing access to the fruits of their collective efforts. 
(Even here we have a definitional problem: most open source licences
have this effect, but not all - the ones that do are the GPL-style
"copyleft" licences that require derivative works to be licensed on the
same terms as the original works.)  In the software context, this
assurance comes at a cost in terms of tracking the ownership of each
module that is contributed to a software program.  In the biotech/pharma
context, the cost is higher because you aren't just dealing with IP
pedigree problems, you're also dealing with the costs of obtaining
patent protection, which are considerable (unlike with copyright in
software, which arises automatically and without cost to the author). 
So you have to ask yourself whether in this particular case the extra
motivating effect of assuring contributors that their collective efforts
won't be "hijacked" by some corporation for its own profit is worth the
extra transaction costs associated with going open source instead of
just having the contributors donate their work to the public domain. In
this particular case you might be able to create sufficient motivation
for people to contribute in other ways.<br>
      <br>
In this connection, note that some people seem to use the terms "open
source" and "public domain" pretty much interchangeably (ie they
completely ignore the IP aspect of open source).  I think this blurring
of ideas is particularly important to avoid when you are talking about
drug development because it obscures the fundamental policy choice that
society makes when it relies on private corporations to conduct drug
development instead of funding it directly from the public purse.  In a
sense, open source is tinkering around the edges of the status quo, and
so talking about open source as if it were the same thing as public
domain immediately removes from consideration a whole swathe of other
options, like nationalised health provision, that might make better
sense from a social welfare perspective.  In my experience it is
difficult to get people in the US to actually consider the full range of
options because there is such a strong commitment to the private
investment model of funding R&amp;D that open source looks really
radical.  It isn't radical at all when you look at the full spectrum of
possibilities.  A major issue with drug development, from this point of
view, is simply that market forces will naturally tend to direct
research efforts by the private sector to where there is the most
substantial potential return.  The higher the costs of doing the
research, the higher the return must be before it will justify private
investment: so lowering R&amp;D costs by means of a proposal like
Maurer's may help, but if you're still relying on private investment in
the later stages of development, it won't actually shift the focus away
from profitability in the marketplace.  All it does is lower the
threshold (somewhat) for profitability - which is great except that if
other opportunities are still more profitable, these much-needed drugs
will still be neglected.  <br>
      <br>
To illustrate the point, look at the Salk vaccine story.  Maurer's
proposal goes against the conventional wisdom that you will encounter
everywhere, that drugs themselves could never be open sourced because no
pharmaceutical company would ever make the necessary investment in
developing the drug if all its competitors, with roughly equal
resources, can do the same and only one drug will result.  Why go into a
competitive environment if you can avoid it?  In this regard the
experience of pharmaceutical companies' involvement in the development
of the Salk polio vaccine in the early 1950s is instructive.  The
university lab in which the vaccine was created did not have the
capacity to generate enough vaccine for a large-scale field trial, so
there was a recognised need for the involvement of pharmaceutical firms,
which had the appropriate infrastructure in place. Getting the vaccine
through the field trial stage was going to require substantial
investment, was going to be difficult and complex and entailed
substantial risk - before a field trial it was uncertain whether the
vaccine would ever be approved.  However, it was clear that if it could
get past the field trial stage, the vaccine would be very profitable
because the degree of public fear of polio would ensure all parents
would want their children vaccinated. This situation, where you have a
medicine which would have a market but needs substantial further
development with no guarantee of success  (ie a high risk, high payoff
investment), is the classic scenario where there is assumed to be an
incentive problem that should be solved by patent monopoly.  (With low
risk, there's no incentive problem, and with low payoff nobody argues
that patent rights are a solution as there is only value in patent
rights if there is a market for the product.)  In this case there was no
patent, because the vaccine was in the public domain, so if the patent
proponents' argument is correct you would expect insufficient
incentive.  But companies were interested without patents and even in
the end without any exclusive contract to produce field trial vaccine,
because the current pie (government procurement for the field trial) was
some guaranteed income to cover at least part of the investment, the
eventual pie (if approved) was going to be big enough and the costs of
imitation were high enough (ie there would be a significant lead-time
advantage in being ready to roll if the vaccine was approved) that they
felt the risk was worth taking on commercial grounds. <br>
      <br>
Now this story is often told to illustrate the fact that you don't
necessarily need a strong exclusive patent position to induce
pharmaceutical companies to participate in drug development (Maurer's
point).  BUT I would point out that it also illustrates the fact that
the key inducement is the size of the eventual market for the product. 
If there's no big market - and this includes the case of malaria drugs,
where even though there are millions of people who would benefit from
access to the drug, those people don't have any money to pay for them -
then you won't get drug development with or without a patent.  It's not
obvious how the open source approach that Maurer is putting forward will
solve this problem.  Ultimately you still get down to the question of
whether society as a whole thinks it is worth paying for the development
of a particular drug, and if so, whether it would be more efficient to
pay for it directly or indirectly.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>My views on open source and pharmaceutical companies</h3>
My own emphasis re the concept of open source is a little different
from the one underpinning Maurer's proposal.  In adopting the open
source analogy, he explicity takes the Linux project as his model and
emphasises the social/development methodology aspects of open source. 
When I talk about open source in biology, I am specifically interested
in whether private companies in the biotech and pharmaceutical sector
might find it commercially advantageous to make some of their IP
publicly available without seeking direct compensation in the form of
licence fees or other pecuniary consideration.  (That is, I use the term
"open source" to evoke the reasons why some software developers chose to
talk about "open source" rather than "free" software, ie as a strategy
to promote the idea of free software to the commercial world on
pragmatic rather than ideological grounds.)  <br>
      <br>
The obvious question for a for-profit company (eg a pharmaceutical
company) is why give away the crown jewels?  Why would I donate free
access to my intellectual property, that I have generated through my
private investment, to everyone -- including my competitors?  And the
answer is that there are other ways for a firm to benefit from the
adoption and use of its IP, eg: <br>
1. free revealing of IP may establish an advantageous industry standard
which may be useful to a company that hopes to commercialise
complementary goods and services that sit on top of that technology
platform.  In other words, free revealing can lead to growth in a
secondary market that may bring in more revenue than it loses.  <br>
2. free revealing may allow or facilitate improvements to the core
technology.  If the original innovator then gains access to those
improvements, this represents a cost saving in R&amp;D for that company.<br>
3. by revealing its IP, a company may generate a favourable reputation
that is useful in selling associated offerings, by enhancing brand value
or enhancing the company's ability to attract and keep high quality
employees.<br>
 <br>
As with any other strategy, there are costs as well as benefits
associated with an open source approach.  Opportunity costs are the
gains that an innovator could have made by adopting an exclusive
proprietary approach according to the traditional model in biotech and
elsewhere. Actual costs include the costs of producing and then
diffusing an innovation (if you choose to actively build a user
community around your open source product, obviously maintaining and
supporting that community will entail extra costs).<br>
      <br>
Whether the balance of costs and benefits of an open source approach
make it more attractive to an IP owner than the traditional proprietary
approach will depend on the circumstances.  From what I've seen, the
likelihood of pharmaceutical companies "open sourcing" their drugs - the
actual therapeutic molecules - seems very low.  There are two main
reasons for this: <br>
1. Opportunity costs associated with open source.  The major
opportunity cost of adopting an open source exploitation strategy is the
loss of profits you might have made if you had taken an exclusive
proprietary approach.  In most fields that opportunity cost is actually
not all that high, because it turns out there are serious caps on the
return you can realistically get from a limited number of licensees. 
The most important reason for this is that because the patent grant
technically covers the means of achieving an end, not the end in itself,
patents in most fields are quite easy to invent around, so in effect,
the upper limit of the licensing fee you can charge is the estimated
cost to potential licensee of coming up with an alternative way of
achieving the same goal. Interestingly for our purposes, pharmaceuticals
are one of only two exceptions to the rule that patent ownership is not
all that profitable in practice (the other, not co-incidentally, is
chemicals).  The main reason for this is that over the years the
pharmaceutical industry has successfully pushed for patent grants that
are broad enough to effectively cover not just a particular molecule
that happens to have value as a drug, but all the variations of that
molecule that might be effective, and this means that pharmaceutical
patents are actually almost impossible to invent around.  So the
opportunity costs for a pharmaceutical company in giving up an exclusive
proprietary approach to drugs in favour of an open source approach are
likely to be too high for pharma to be interested.  <br>
2. Established business practice: Pharmaceutical companies rely heavily
on patent positions - whether or not they have a patent on a particular
pharmaceutical product makes a big difference both to the results of
their operations in terms of the economics of selling drugs, and to the
company's valuation on the stock market; and this translates into a big
emphasis on IP, to a degree even in areas that aren't really related to
their proprietary position on their drug products. In other words, not
sharing IP is deeply ingrained.  To a large degree the biotech industry
has inherited that culture of not sharing.  The costs of changing
established business practice are very real in terms of organisational
structure and providing incentives for your employees to shift the way
they look at things - and so there is plenty of inertia for large,
established companies like the big pharma companies when it comes to
adopting fundamentally new business models like open source.<br>
      <br>
But that doesn't mean open source has no application in relation to the
pharmaceutical industry.  For example: <br>
1. One established use of open source business strategies in the
software context is to pre-empt the establishment of proprietary
technological standards owned by your rivals.  Even though
pharmaceutical companies hate sharing, one thing they hate even more is
being beholden to a single supplier for some critical value driver. 
This means they might be prepared to put money into an open source
biotech company that planned to come up with a really critical tool --
say a toxicology tool that would help predict R&amp;D failures before a
drug hit the expensive clinical phase of development.  This is a
significant example because currently, exclusive patent positions are
important to biotech start-ups largely as a way to attract capital.  So
this kind of support would provide a credible alternative story for
biotech start-ups to tell potential investors and thus could promote the
development of open source strategies in the biotechnology sector.<br>
2. Using open source as a form of leverage to gain access to
improvements to its technology that other people have made for their own
purposes: this is of course a form of pre-competitive collaboration,
well known in other industries despite high capital costs and time
investments.  Ironically, the closest to a true open source arrangement
that I've come across in interviews was in the heart of exclusive IP
territory - in the business model of a successful biotech firm that
provides data to pharmaceutical companies.  This biotech firm had a
licensing arrangement where if any of their customers discovers and
characterises a full length gene using the information in their
database, the customer has to grant back to the biotech company AND to
all of its other customers non-exclusive freedom to operate in drug
discovery.  Initially this clause was inserted in order to allow
customers to use the data without fear of infringement suits from other
customers, but it came to be seen as an additional source of value -
customers aren't just getting access to the biotech firm's data, they're
also getting access to information from all of their rivals.  The most
interesting part of this story is that this has been happening since the
biotech firm set up shop in the early 1990s, some time before Linux
took off.<br>
      <br>
It's also important to note that even if only one or two companies or
institutions in a given industry sector choose to go open source, the
actions of those companies have a big impact.  By undermining customers
willingness to pay for access to tools from one company that they can
get at a lower cost or even for free elsewhere, a couple of open source
players can shift the basis of competition in the sector away from
proprietary technologies.  So in this sense, open source really has the
power to transform industries.  This is one reason why Maurer's proposal
is quite exciting - but it also means you'd expect resistance from
established firms to anything that looked like open source.  We
shouldn't underestimate the power of big pharma to influence how open
source is perceived if they felt it would be to their disadvantage. 
Also note that it wouldn't have to be a company that provided open
source technologies in order to have this industry-wide effect: it could
be a non-profit organisation.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>Applicability of open source in non-IT intensive areas</h3>
There are a few things to say here.<br>
      <br>
First, one objection to the idea of open source in non-software biotech
applications relates to the cost of conducting distributed R&amp;D where
the innovation in question is not just a string of software code that
can be cheaply and instantaneously sent from one collaborator to another
via the internet, but may also have a material element and in any case
is not likely to be perfectly well defined in an information sense (eg a
GM mouse or a cell line).  If you talk to people who are already
running large scale, geographically dispersed biological research
collaborations, it turns out these costs are in fact not a significant
drain on resources or an obstacle to progress.<br>
      <br>
Second, another objection relates to the supposed difficulty of
building a user community in biotech due to the greater skill needed by
biotech researchers relative to software programmers.  The idea is that
the pool of potential contributors to a project would be too small to
get it off the ground.  I dont think this is a serious issue.  Its
true that Linux harnesses input from thousands of contributors, but in
this respect its actually atypical: most open source software projects
have fewer than twenty contributors. Its also true that although some
biological research requires high skill levels, a lot of it is basically
gruntwork.  <br>
      <br>
Third, another common objection in relation to open source biotech is
that the cost of actually doing the research was significantly higher
than in software development. <br>
Speaking to people running research groups in both software and
biotech, I've found that labour costs were by far the largest cost for
both types of research, with the cost of supplies and other wet lab
inventory being relatively small and generally on the decline.  Of
course in really big science areas like the human genome project, the
work is on such a huge scale that these sorts of costs start to really
add up.  But in general, the ability to do more and more research using
computers instead of chemicals is making biological research more and
more accessible to people without huge resources.  In that sense there
isn't really any stage of the drug development process that is not in
some sense "IT intensive" these days - or more accurately, in areas
where the process is still largely uncomputerised (eg clinical trials),
there is nevertheless plenty of scope for computer applications that
could improve the process.  <br>
      <br>
As you can see from my earlier comments, I don't actually think that
whether open source is relevant in a particular context really depends
on absolute costs of resources or the absolute amount of investment
required.  Instead, it's a trade-off between exclusive and non-exclusive
exploitation strategies for a given innovation -- a matter of relative
costs and benefits, not absolutes.  For many software applications, the
exclusive approach is rational; conversely, for many biotech
applications, a non-exclusive/open source approach will be rational. 
The innovation literature is full of examples of essentially open source
strategies that pre-date Linux and the free software movement (going
back to the 19th century and even further) that brought plenty of
benefits to commercial players in industries that are much more capital
intensive than software - including textiles and steel manufacturing.<br>
      <br>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The preceding discussion raises many issues that cannot yet be
resolved, but does not appear to indicate there is any fundamental
difference between the software and biotechnology context which renders
the open source approach generally irrelevant to biotechnology research
and development. Open source licensing will not be suitable to every
biotechnology enterprise, just as it is not always the best scheme for
developing software; on the other hand, charging for access to
intellectual property is also no guarantee of business success.</p>
      <p>Key issues for advancing the open source biotechnology
analysis will be developing open source patent licences and other
licences appropriate for biotechnological subject matter, assessing the
importance of higher capital costs in biotechnology development and
establishing whether or not there exist secondary markets for
biotechnology services or other commercial offerings that might support
business models along the lines that have proved successful in the
software context. Other important issues include the costs of exchanging
uncodified information and the amenability of biotechnology research to
being broken up into relatively fine-grained modules that can be
developed in parallel by contributors possessing varying degrees of
motivation (refer to Benkler).</p>
      <p>The purpose of this study is to examine these and other issues
through interviews, case studies and literature analysis. The ultimate
goal is to either demonstrate the commercial feasibility or otherwise of
an open source approach to biotechnology research and development.
Preliminary interviews suggest that many biotechnology researchers are
interested in this question (though opinions are heavily polarised), but
that advancing the analysis is secondary to meeting research deadlines
and existing funding requirements. It is hoped that this project will
facilitate discussion of issues relating to open source biotechnology;
in adopting this objective the project is intended to supplement rather
than supplant other similar efforts, including the Open Source
Biotechnology initiative at the Molecular Sciences Institue, the open
source bioinformatics and neuroinformatics movements, Tom Knight's (MIT)
standard biobricks project, Tom Michaels' (OAC) General Public Licence
for Plant Germplasm, the open hardware movement, Al Gilman's Alliance
for Cellular Signalling, and the Human Genome Project's Bermuda Rules
(no doubt there are many others).</p>

      <h2>Post Script: A speculative future for open source
biotechnology</h2>
      <p>The following extracts are taken from verbatim transcripts of
seminars I delivered during 2002 on the topic of open source
biotechnnology. Some of the material has also been used elsewhere in
this website. This page is very much under construction! The point to
keep in mind is that nobody can predict what will happen with respect to
open source biotechnology. But it's tempting to think about what <em>could</em>
happen....</p>
      <p>Seminar 1:</p>
      <p>"What would happen if open source biotech schemes starting
taking off? Besides just being a superior business model in some cases,
open source approach could be used not just for tactical advantage but
also as a strategic weapon, to reshape markets by establishing open
standards, preventing other players from getting a proprietary choke
hold on important tools and resetting the competition in favour of
weaker players. Rebecca Eisenberg has suggested that the similarities
between software development and genomics in connection with the open
source approach may be more ideological and rhetorical than economic. If
Eisenberg says this is true in biomedical biotechnology, then I think we
can believe her, but it seems to me there are strong parallels between
the software industry, dominated by Microsoft, and the agbiotech
industry, dominated by a handful of powerful oligopolists. In both
cases, smaller organisations that try to compete with the big players
for their own turf are sensibly crushed by the monopoly. The imbalance
of power and resources is just too great. But monopolies will never
offer their customers choice and control over the product itself -- that
is the source of their power. However, this is something that customers
really want, in biotech as in the computer world. The consumer backlash
against genetically modified foods has been complex, but one of its
most striking themes has been resentment at having the decision whether
to eat this stuff or grow this stuff taken out of one's hands.</p>
      <p>"One important question, supposing open source biotech did get
off the ground, would be how the big players would be likely to react.
What they perceive open source as a threat and take action to destroy
it? Or would they see some benefits in it for themselves and take a more
benevolent line? In the software world, Microsoft's attempts to remove
their main open source competitor, Linux, have failed. It might be fair
say that open source licences are popular precisely because they are a
"monopoly resistant" business scheme in an industry which has otherwise
been very friendly to the dominant players.</p>
      <p>"One optimistic vision that has been put to me is that if an
open source initiative began developing the next revolutionary tool in
agbiotech, then instead of trying to block this initiative and racing to
get there first, the big players might calculate that the value of
having freedom to operate in relation to such a tool would outweigh the
fact that everyone else would have access to it as well. My first
reaction to this vision, if indeed I understood it rightly, was that if
an open source initiative could envisage such a revolutionary new tool,
surely so could the oligopolists, and instead of supporting as open
initiative, they would rush to gain monopoly control over it. But
perhaps in the light of public-private sector initiatives like the SNP
consortium, I am underestimating the value of freedom to operate for
these big firms. A more pessimistic vision would be that the big players
would take action to undermine the use of open source as a competitive
weapon.</p>
      <p>"These speculations relate to the medium-term future, and of
course they are highly uncertain. Perhaps the most likely long-term
outcome of a move towards open source biotech would be neither be
completely open source industry nor total destruction of the open source
impulse by big players. Instead we might end up with a kind of
ecosystem, incorporating both open source and proprietary elements. We
might expect that scientific resources that represent non-substitutable
standards -- for example, the sequence of the human genome -- would be
open source, while standalone vertical markets where network effects are
weak would tend to be populated mainly by proprietary tools. In such an
ecosystem, there would be a role for competition law to intervene to
maintain a productive equilibrium between proprietary and open source
elements. Competition law could also, of course, play an important role
in getting us there from here."</p>
      <p>Seminar 2:</p>
      <p>"Okay, so I've spent quite a lot of time describing the
individual organisation's perspective on going open source, and so far
that's the perspective to which I've devoted the most thought. Now I
just want to make a couple of brief comments about the broader industry
or community perspective.</p>
      <p>"The image on the slide is of David and Goliath, which is to
remind us that there are substantial imbalances of power and resources
in the agbiotech industry and the industry as a whole. In the last few
years ag biotech has come to be dominated by an oligopoly of only about
5 large firms, and one reason that many research organisations outside
that oligopoly are interested in initiatives like the IP clearinghouse
is that they are looking for ways to counter the effects of oligopoly
ownership of enabling technologies - that is, critical research tools.</p>
      <p>"If the open source business model were to take hold in the ag
biotech industry and then perhaps in biomedical biotech, how would that
affect industry structure? Would it in fact favour the smaller players,
as the David and Goliath analogy suggests, or would it favour those who
already control most of the resources?</p>
      <p>"It's interesting to note that in the software context, leaked
documents have revealed that Microsoft's attitude to Linux is one of
fear and hostility, and it would not be surprising if we were to see a
serious backlash against open source. Would larger players in the
agbiotech industry react any differently to the growth of a successful
open source community? What about the biotech industry generally -
pharmaceutical firms are notorious for playing hard ball over IP issues.</p>
      <p>"At this stage of my research I'm not ready to propose answers
to these questions, but I have thought a bit about how to carry out the
analysis. The difficulty is that like any complex system, technology
innovation systems will react unpredictably to change. This means that
to study them effectively, you have to apply the principles of system
dynamics. Unfortunately, these principles are currently fairly
inaccessible because they are generally expressed in purely mathematical
terms. At present, I'm in the early stages of a side project aiming to
articulate system dynamics principles in a rigorous but non mathematical
way so they can be applied to this particular problem.</p>
      <p>From a more traditional legal perspective, of course, systems
theory is a branch of regulatory theory, so if you look at the question
of the likely industry effects of an open source biotechnology movement,
in legal terms you are really asking whether and how governments -- or
other players -- should intervene to bring about desired policy effects
in what is otherwise a self-regulating system. So to summarise with
respect to industry effects, I will be drawing on both system dynamics
and legal regulatory theory to examine these issues."</p>
